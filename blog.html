    <h2>Local Storage vs session storage</h2>
    <p>The main difference between localStorage and sessionStorage is that sessionStorage is unique per tab. If you
        close the tab the sessionStorage gets deleted, localStorage does not. Also you cannot communicate between tabs
        Another subtle difference is that for example on Safari (8.0.3) localStorage has a limit of 2551 k characters
        but sessionStorage has unlimited storage</p>
    <p>Since local storage is persistent, it's your best bet to retain data across user visits. If you want to store
        site preferences or cache long-term data, local storage is appropriate. You may not want to store more sensitive
        data using local storage, since it is permanent.

        As local and session storage are front-end methods, you may want to avoid using them for server-based functions
        like user login. You could consider cookies as an alternative in these cases.</p>
